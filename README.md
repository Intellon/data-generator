# data-generator
This library allows to save a collection of objects to a CSV file.
It also allows loading from CSV files with linq expressions.

It is:
 - Simple to add to your application (Single C# file)
 - Simple to use (loading and saving can be done with a single line of code)
 - Fast (the demo creates a million client records in 2 seconds on my laptop)
 - Small memory footprint (tested with over 10,0000,000 records).
